# 🏗️ System Architecture

Technical design documents and architectural decisions.

## Purpose

**Design documentation** explaining how the system works. These documents describe:
- System structure and components
- Design decisions and trade-offs
- Integration patterns
- Security models

## Guidelines

- Focus on **WHY** not just WHAT
- Include diagrams where helpful
- Document alternatives considered
- Keep updated as system evolves
