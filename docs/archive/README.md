# 🗄️ Archive

Historical and deprecated documentation.

## Purpose

**Outdated or superseded documents** that are kept for:
- Historical reference
- Context on past decisions
- Lessons learned

## Guidelines

- Organize by date: `YYYY-MM/`
- Include **deprecation note** at top of archived docs
- Don't edit archived docs (historical record)
- Link from current docs to archive when relevant
